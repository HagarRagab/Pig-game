## Game's idea

Pink Dice is a simple game that demonstrates DOM manipulation and is designed for two players. Each player takes turns rolling the dice multiple times and can choose to press the hold button at any point to keep their score. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score, and it becomes the other player's turn. The first player will obtain 100 points wins the game.
